## Reddit-Data-Scraping

redditusing_praw.py uses PRAW API which only gives you ~1000 results.

reddit.py uses pushshift api which can scrape the whole subreddit.

Just make sure you don't much load to api just keep the difference between the before and after time short like 4-5 months.

Change line 39,40,41,42 and 63 as u wish.
